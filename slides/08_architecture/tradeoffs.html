We know what to build, but how? How to we meet the quality goals?

![Architecture between requirements and implementation](req-arch-impl.svg)
<!-- .element: class="plain" -->

**Software architecture:** Key design decisions, made early in the
  development, focusing on key product qualities

Architectural decisions are hard to change later
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## Architecture Decisions: Examples

* What are the major components in the system? What does each
component do? 
* Where do the components live? Monolithic vs microservices?
* How do components communicate to each other? Synchronous vs
asynchronous calls?
* What API does each component publish? Who can access this API?
* Where does the ML inference happen? Client-side or server-side?
* Where is the telemetry data collected from the users stored?
* How large should the user database be? Centralized vs decentralized?
* ...and many others
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## Software Architecture

> Architecture represents the set of **significant** **design** decisions that shape the form and the function of a system, where **significant** is measured by cost of change.

![Design](design.png)
<!-- .element: class="stretch" -->


Software Engineering Theme: *Think before you code*

Like requirements: Slower initially, but upfront investment can prevent problems later and save overall costs

-> Focus on most important qualities early, but leave flexibility
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Why Architecture? ([Kazman et al. 2012](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/software-architecture-in/9780132942799/?ar))

<div class="small">

Represents earliest design decisions.

Aids in **communication** with stakeholders: Shows them “how” at a level they can understand, raising questions about whether it meets their needs

Defines **constraints** on implementation: Design decisions form “load-bearing walls” of application

Dictates **organizational structure**: Teams work on different components

Inhibits or enables **quality attributes**: Similar to design patterns

Supports **predicting** cost, quality, and schedule: Typically by predicting information for each component

Aids in software **evolution**: Reason about cost, design, and effect of changes

</div>

</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## Quality Requirements Drive Architecture Design

Driven by requirements, identify most important qualities

Examples:
* Development cost, operational cost, time to release
* Scalability, availability, response time, throughput
* Security, safety, usability, fairness
* Ease of modifications and updates
* ML: Accuracy, ability to collect data, training latency

</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">### Common Components in ML-based Systems

* **Model inference service**: Uses model to make predictions for input data
* **ML pipeline**: Infrastructure to train/update the model
* **Monitoring**: Observe model and system
* **Data sources**: Manual/crowdsourcing/logs/telemetry/...
* **Data management**: Storage and processing of data, often at scale
* **Feature store**: Reusable feature engineering code, cached feature computations
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## Common System-Wide Design Challenges

Separating concerns, understanding interdependencies
* e.g., anticipating/breaking feedback loops, conflicting needs of components

Facilitating experimentation, updates with confidence

Separating training and inference; closing the loop
* e.g., collecting telemetry to learn from user interactions

Learn, serve, and observe at scale or with resource limits
* e.g., cloud deployment, embedded devices

Examples:
* Personalized music recommendations: microservice deployment in cloud, logging of user activity, nightly batch processing for inference, regular model updates, regular experimentation, easy fallback
* Transcription service: irregular user interactions, large model, expensive inference, inference latency not critical, rare model updates
* Autonomous vehicle: on-board hardware sets limits, real-time needs, safety critical, updates necessary, limited experimentation in practice, not always online
* Smart keyboard: privacy focused, small model, federated learning on user device, limited telemetry
