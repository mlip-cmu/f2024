# Case Study: Music Generation
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## Context: Music Generation Research


*Lam, Max WY, et al. "Efficient neural music generation." Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 36 (2024).*

<div class="small">

> Recent progress in music generation has been remarkably advanced by the state-of-the-art MusicLM, which comprises a hierarchy of three LMs, respectively, for semantic, coarse acoustic, and fine acoustic modelings. Yet, sampling with the MusicLM requires processing through these LMs one by one to obtain the fine-grained acoustic tokens, making it computationally expensive and prohibitive for a real-time generation. Efficient music generation with a quality on par with MusicLM remains a significant challenge.In this paper, we present MeLoDy (M for music; L for LM; D for diffusion), an LM-guided diffusion model that generates music audios of state-of-the-art quality meanwhile reducing 95.7\% to 99.6\% forward passes in MusicLM, respectively, for sampling 10s to 30s music. MeLoDy inherits the highest-level LM from MusicLM for semantic modeling, and applies a novel dual-path diffusion (DPD) model and an audio VAE-GAN to efficiently decode the conditioning semantic tokens into waveform. DPD is proposed to simultaneously model the coarse and fine acoustics by incorporating the semantic information into segments of latents effectively via cross-attention at each denoising step. Our experimental results suggest the superiority of MeLoDy, not only in its practical advantages on sampling speed and infinitely continuable generation, but also in its state-of-the-art musicality, audio quality, and text correlation.Our samples are available at https://Efficient-MeLoDy.github.io/.

</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## The Startup Idea

Just completed a research thesis as part of your Master's/PhD degree about making deep learning for generative AI more energy efficient. 

Your recent project was using music generation as a case study. You showed 30% energy improvements with similar quality of generated music on benchmark prompts.

Two friends are becoming excited about the application of music generation

Idea: Let's commercialize the idea and sell it to end users or music producers.

Take audio or video files and produce text.
- Used by academics to analyze interview text
- Podcast show notes
- Subtitles for videos

State of the art a few years ago: Manual transcription, often mechanical turk (1.5 $/min)

Recently: Many ML models for transcription (e.g., in Youtube, Alexa, Siri, Zoom)

<aside class="notes"><p>Highlights challenging fragments. Can see what users fix inplace to correct. Star rating for feedback.</p>
</aside></script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template"><div class="small">

## Examples for discussion

* What does correctness or accuracy really mean? What accuracy do customers care about?
* How can we see how well we are doing in practice? How much feedback are customers going to give us before they leave?
* Can we estimate how good our transcriptions are? How are we doing for different customers or different topics?
* How to present results to the customers (including confidence)?
* When customers complain about poor transcriptions, how to prioritize and what to do?
* 
* What are unacceptable mistakes and how can they be avoided? Is there a safety risk?
* Can we cope with an influx of customers?
* Will transcribing the same audio twice produce the same result? Does it matter? 
* How can we debug and fix problems? How quickly?

</div></script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template"><div class="small">

## Examples for discussion 2

* With more customers, transcriptions are taking longer and longer -- what can we do?
* Transcriptions sometimes crash. What to do?
* How do we achieve high availability?
* How can we see that everything is going fine and page somebody if it is not?
* We improve our entity detection model but somehow system behavior degrades... Why?
* Tensorflow update; does our infrastructure still work?
* Once somewhat successful, how to handle large amounts of data per day?
* Buy more machines or move to the cloud?
*
* Models are continuously improved. When to deploy? Can we roll back?
* Can we offer live transcription as an app? As a web service?
* Can we get better the longer a person talks? Should we then go back and reanalyze the beginning? Will this benefit the next upload as well?

</div></script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template"><div class="small">

## Examples for discussion 3

* How many domains can be supported? Do we have the server capacity?
* How specific should domains be? Medical vs "International Conference on Allergy & Immunology"?
* How to make it easy to support new domains?
* 
* Can we handle accents? 
* Better recognition of male than female speakers?
* 
* Can and should we learn from customer data? 
* How can we debug problems on audio files we are not allowed to see?
* Any chance we might private leak customer data? 
* Can competitors or bad actors attack our system?

Introducing various tools, e.g., fastAPI (serving), Kafka (stream processing), Jenkins (continuous integration), MLflow (experiment tracking), Docker & Kubernetis (containers), Prometheus & Grafana (monitoring), CHAP (explainability)...

Hands on exercises, bring a laptop

Often introducing tools useful for assignments

about 1h of work, graded pass/fail, low stakes, show work to TA

First lab on **this Friday**: Calling, securing, and creating APIs

We recommend to start at lab before the recitation, but can be completed during

Graded pass/fail by TA on the spot, can retry

*Relaxed collaboration policy:* Can work with others before and during recitation, but have to present/explain solution to TA individually

(Think of recitations as mandatory office hours)

## Grading

* 35% individual assignment
* 30% group project with final presentation
* 15% two midterms

Specification grading, based in adult learning theory

Giving you choices in what to work on or how to prioritize your work

We are making every effort to be clear about expectations (specifications), will clarify if you have questions


Assignments broken down into expectations with point values, each graded **pass/fail**

Opportunities to resubmit work until last day of class

- Submit individual assignment 1 day late for 1 token (after running out of tokens 15% penalty per late day)
- Redo individual assignment for 3 token
- Resubmit or submit reading quiz late for 1 token
- Redo or complete a lab late for 1 token (show in office hours)
- Remaining tokens count toward participation

8 team tokens per team:
- Submit milestone 1 day late for 1 token (no late submissions accepted when out of tokens)
- Redo milestone for 3 token

* No need to tell us if you plan to submit very late. We will assign 0 and you can resubmit
* Instructions and Google form for resubmission on Canvas (pages)
* We will automatically use remaining tokens toward participation at the end
* Remaining individual tokens reflected on Canvas, for remaining team tokens ask your team mentor.

Instructor-assigned teams

Teams stay together for project throughout semester, starting Sep 16

Fill out Catme Team survey before Sep 13 (3pt)


Some advice in lectures; we'll help with debugging team issues

TA assigned to each team as mentor; mandatory debriefing with mentor and peer grading on all milestones (based on citizenship on team)

Bonus points for social interaction in project teams

## Academic honesty

See web page

In a nutshell: do not copy from other students, do not lie, do not share or publicly release your solutions

In group work, be honest about contributions of team members, do not cover for others

Collaboration okay on labs, but not quizzes, individual assignments, or exams
